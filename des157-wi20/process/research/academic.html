        <p class="para">Internet censorship puts restrictions on what information can be publicized or viewed on the Internet. Governments and other organizations commonly use internet censorship to block access to copyrighted information as well as to harmful or sensitive content. However, internet censorship can also be used as a propaganda method to promote specific religions and political agendas.</p>
        <p class="para">In the beginning, the Internet was monitored by the Internet community rather than by governments or official organizations. The goal was to avoid government interference in order to promote freedom of speech and lack of prejudice. Though these initial sentiments were admirable in theory, governments and other bodies have been increasingly monitoring the Internet after concluding that self-monitoring was no longer adequate to solve emerging issues. Several examples of these issues included the increase of criminal activity on the Internet, the evolution of the Internet as a social phenomenon, the diversity of Internet users, and the advent of various political doctrines on the Internet.</p>
        <p class="para">To conclude, internet censorship exists to
            <ul>
                <li>prevent individuals accessing copyrighted information</li>
                <li>stop people from viewing harmful or sensitive content</li>
                <li>promote particular religions and political ideas</li>
                <li>control Internet-related and Internet-communicated crime</li>
                <li>monitor the billions of people on the Internet with varying opinions and preferences</li>
            </ul></p>
        <p class="para">Thus, internet censorship acts as a viable method by governments and official organizations to manage what their citizens can view.</p>
        <p class="para">The pro-democracy think tank Freedom House show the relative internet freedom of countries around the globe with Russia, China, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Turkey amongst others suffering obstacles to access, limits on content and violations of users’ rights that put them in the “not free” category. Other nations, designated “partly free”, include Ukraine, Brazil, India, Mexico and Indonesia. All too few achieve “free”: the USA, Canada, parts of Europe, Japan, Australia and South Africa. </p>
        <p class="para">Still, there have always been deliberate loopholes. Take VPNs, tools that allow users in China to tunnel into the Internet via a different country. Virtual private networks enable users to encrypt traffic, circumvent censorship and experience the Internet exactly as if they were in the United States, for example, albeit at a cost in terms of browsing speed. The Chinese government has long known and accepted the fact that a small percentage of its population circumvents the Firewall using VPNs. It is, after all, essential that domestic and foreign businesses be able to access information across borders, and it keeps the English- speaking elite happy to allow them a small window on the world.</p>
        <p class="para">It might feel like the fist of government is closing around the throat of internet freedoms, but there are still governments committed to internet freedom.

        For the second time in 2017, France struck down a provision that criminalized the regular consultation of websites deemed to incite or glorify terrorism. The UK saw the first “right to be forgotten” judgement as the High Court ordered Google to delist search results referring to a spent criminal conviction of a businessman. While the Canadian government promises to reform elements of the Anti-Terrorism Act, which permits information-sharing across government agencies for a broad range of purposes, Italy announced the launch of an online portal to report ‘fake news’ to the police. 
            </p>
        <p class="para">For those in the West, it is essential that we don’t assume our freedoms are assured, and that we challenge legislation and its legislators - especially that which is suspiciously positioned as protecting us. If your ability to voice your opposition is removed or punishable, you will know it’s too late.</p>
